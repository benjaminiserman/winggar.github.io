  Red was a fruit flavor of Mountain Dew,<br>
  and since it was around for a short amount<br>
  of time, its actual fruit flavor profile is<br>
  relatively unknown. Its color, as its name<br>
  implies, has a red look.

    Research shows that consumption of these highly-caffeinated<br>
    drinks can lead to a potentially serious heart condition known<br>
    as Atrial Fibrillation, or Afib, a type of irregular heartbeat<br>
    (arrhythmia) occurring in the upper chambers of the heart. If<br>
    left untreated, Afib could cause heart palpitations, blood clots,<br>
    stroke, and even heart failure in extreme cases. The American<br>
    Heart Association estimates that at least 2.7 million Americans<br>
    are currently living with Afib.

    In 1988, Mountain Dew Red first began as a<br>
    test market release in some regions of Alabama.<br>
    During its one-year run, a low-calorie variant<br>
    of Red called Diet Mountain Dew Red was also<br>
    test-marketed. Both variants were then later<br>
    discontinued that same year, and since their<br>
    discontinuation, neither PepsiCo nor the<br>
    independent Pepsi bottler, Buffalo Rock, has<br>
    acknowledged the flavor in recent times.
